# FS Pilot Briefings
This is a project to unify pilot briefings (airport guides and event guides, etc) for flight simulator users on the VATSIM Network.

## Roadmap
### 1) Initial
Initially, we will compile & aggregate links to VATSIM pilot briefings & airport guides.

_Where a source cannot be verified, we will exercise discretion over its inclusion._

### 2) Updates from source
We'll allow facility staff to verify their internal VATSIM credentials and gain access to add/remove/edit entries for their areas of responsibility.

### 3) Centralised source
We'll have a central documentation repository. At this point, there will be different types of entries.
1. **Hosted repositories.** Contribute directly to a central repository.
2. **Remote repositories.** Share your own repository & have it mirrored.
3. **Offsite links.** Share external links, just like before.

Options (1) and (2) will be presented as a _Material by MkDocs_ page, hosted by FSAsia.

**If** there is significant interest, we'll consider adding API read/write access.
