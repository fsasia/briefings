# VatBrief - pilot briefings index
This is a project to unify pilot briefings (airport guides and event guides, etc) for flight simulator users on the VATSIM Network.

## Contribute/Update Data
Read Contributing.md

## Roadmap
- [x] Data set initialised
- [x] Data set presented on a NextJS app in Cloudflare Pages
- [ ] API read/write access to data set
- [ ] Centralised docs site
### Centralised docs site?
The goal is to have a single, central Briefings site containing official pilot docs. Facilities may choose between:
1. **Hosted doc repository.** Write directly to a central docs repository
2. **Remote repositories.** Point VatBrief to read from your own repository
3. **Offsite links.** Link to external resources, just like the current state
