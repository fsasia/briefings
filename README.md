# FS Pilot Briefings
This is a project to unify pilot briefings (airport guides and event guides, etc) for flight simulator users on the VATSIM Network.

## Roadmap
### 1) Initial
Initially, we will compile & aggregate links to VATSIM pilot briefings & airport guides. Our focus is on site refinement, 
bug fixing, and data completeness.

_Where a source cannot be verified, we will exercise discretion over its inclusion._

ETA: **Ongoing**

### 2) API Access
We will open the VatBrief.com API for integration into your own projects.

ETA: TBD

### 3) Centralised source
We'll have a central documentation repository. At this point, there will be different types of entries.
1. **Hosted repositories.** Contribute directly to a central repository maintained by VatBrief.com.
2. **Remote repositories.** Maintain your own repository & have it mirrored on VatBrief.com.
3. **Offsite links.** Link to your own site, just like now.

Options (1) and (2) will be presented as a Markdown document on VatBrief.com.

ETA: TBD
